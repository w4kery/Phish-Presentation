# Team Security Awareness Initiative
## Introduction

It's time to enhance the security awareness of our teams based on the results of the recent phishing simulation. The analysis revealed variations in susceptibility across different departments, and now our focus is on identifying areas that need more awareness about phishing. Subsequently, we will design and implement targeted training to mitigate the risk of potential attacks.
